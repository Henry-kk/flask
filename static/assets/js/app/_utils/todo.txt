- utils.date-is-greater-than.directive -- should be removed,
                    when ark-components' timepicker is implemented instead of ui-timepicker

- utils.ui-slider.directive -- should be removed, and replaced with ARK slider


Most of directives are used only once, and their logic are very specific, need to transfer to Controller
